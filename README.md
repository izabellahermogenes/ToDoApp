## Build Process

1. Set up a new Expo project with TypeScript support.  
2. Defined `Todo` interface to type-check todo objects.  
3. Managed todos, moods, and filters with React hooks (`useState`).  
4. Implemented functions for adding, toggling, deleting, and filtering todos.  
5. Created a custom progress circle using Views and transforms (no SVG).  
6. Styled the app with React Native's `StyleSheet` for consistency and ease of maintenance.  
7. Tested on device and simulators for smooth user experience.
